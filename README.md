# Docker Image for Jekyll-based Website

This docker image is used to host my [personal website](conghui.me). Only the
required `gem` packages are installed for my personal blog. You may not able
to use this image to host your jekyll website if additional dependencies are
needed in your website. Of course, you may customize the `Dockerfile` as you
want.
